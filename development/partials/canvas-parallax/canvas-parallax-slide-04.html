									The Exercises are designed to assist the individual facing an important life-decision. They begin with and build upon a careful examination of one’s life experiences and interior life. They encourage a careful examination of one’s motives and values. They foster the interior freedom that allows one to move forward with gratitude for one’s past and a deepening of one’s commitments toward the future. Expert guides are provided for the newcomer to the Exercises.

										Each of the weekend sessions is composed of visits to programs dealing with the significant issues of the day, and especially with the training of young leaders. How are the Jesuits attempting to prepare men and women dedicated to the common good as opposed to a narrow focus on personal benefit? What are the obstacles to accomplishing this and maintaining programs that foster a new kind of civic leader?									</p>
