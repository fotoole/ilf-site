				<p class="body">The Ignatian Legacy Fellows Program is a yearlong program that includes personal reflection, guided meditation, spiritual readings and discussion, and volunteer service – all pointed towards helping participants better understand where they might be called to use their gifts in service of others.</p>
				<p class="body">Four-day residency sessions are held every two months. These highly dialogical and interactive sessions encourage participants to discuss theological texts, engage with thought-provoking speakers, and share life experiences. Journaling, online reading, and response work complement the sessions. </p>
				<p class="body">In addition to these residencies, participants will also embark on a service immersion trip to a Jesuit mission in Lima, Peru. The program culminates with a pilgrimage to Spain, to visit Barcelona, St. Ignatius’ birthplace, and Manresa, where he wrote the Spiritual Exercises.</p>
