        <h4 class="accordion-ilf">Spiritual Guidance</h4>
        <div class="panel-ilf">
          <p class="body">The Spiritual Exercises are designed to assist the individual in better understanding the purpose of his or her life. They begin with and build upon a careful examination of one’s life experiences and interior life and encourage a careful examination of one’s motives and values. They foster the interior freedom that allows one to move forward with gratitude for one’s past while deepening one’s commitments toward the future. Expert guides are provided for the newcomer to the Exercises.

        <h4 class="accordion-ilf">Intellectual Stimulation</h4>
        <div class="panel-ilf">
          <p class="body">The highly dialogical and interactive sessions encourage participants to engage with assigned readings and the presentations by thought-provoking speakers, as well as discussions with faculty and students.</p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="accordion-ilf">Sharing Professional Expertise</h4>
        <div class="panel-ilf">
          <p class="body">Each of the weekend sessions is composed of visits to programs dealing with the significant issues of the day, especially with the training of young leaders. How are the Jesuits attempting to prepare men and women dedicated to the common good as opposed to a narrow focus on personal benefit? What are the obstacles to accomplishing this and maintaining programs that foster a new kind of civic leader?</p>

      <p class="body">
        Our participants are C-suite executives, organizational leaders, and nonprofit executives nearing or in retirement, who want to use their accumulated skills and expertise in service to others, regardless of their faith tradition.
