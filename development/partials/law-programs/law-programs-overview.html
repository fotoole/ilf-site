  Employers are increasingly demanding practice-ready law graduates. Our students complete at least six credit hours in externships, comprehensive simulation courses, clinics, or practica. Working with a faculty of nationally-recognized leaders in their fields, youâ€™ll learn to apply substantive law in service to clients in a real practice setting before graduation.
